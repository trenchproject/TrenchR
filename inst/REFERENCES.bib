abstract = {Mechanistic niche models characterise the fundamental niche of an organism by determining thermodynamic constraints on its heat, water and nutritional budget, and the consequences of this for growth, development and reproduction. They can thus quantify constraints on survival, activity and, ultimately, the vital rates that determine population growth, given a sequence of environmental conditions and the key morphological, physiological and behavioural functional traits. Here we introduce and document the ectotherm model of NicheMapR, an R package that includes a suite of programs for the mechanistic modelling of heat, water, energy and mass exchange between any kind of ectothermic organism and its environment. The NicheMapR ectotherm model is based on a Fortran program originally developed by Porter, Mitchell and Beckman for predicting core body temperature and evaporative water loss as a function of microclimatic conditions and behavioural thermoregulation. The model includes routines for computing steady state body temperature and evaporative water loss given two extreme microclimates (minimum and maximum shade) as computed by the NicheMapR microclimate model. Behavioural options include posture and colour change, shade-seeking, panting, climbing and retreating underground. Here we configure the program to be called from R as part of the NicheMapR package and describe the model in detail including new functionality for modelling whole life-cycle energy and water budgets using Dynamic Energy Budget theory. We include scripts for core operation of the ectotherm model as well as stand-alone R scripts for running the DEB model. Example applications are provided in the paper and in the associated vignettes. The integrated microclimate and ectotherm models should provide a strong thermodynamic basis for determining the effects of environmental change on the behaviour, distribution and abundance of ectothermic organisms.},

This relation is based on the convection equation for a sphere, and employs a simple, unique characteristic dimension to represent the animal which is the cube root of the animal volume. The accuracy of this relation is established through comparison with available convection results from animal shapes ranging in size and shape from spiders to cows. This relation allows an extrapolation to animal shapes for which data are not available. Results are also presented for the enhancement of convection heat transfer due to natural turbulence. A procedure is outlined for estimating the convecture heat loss from an animal in the natural outdoor environment.}

The models, originally developed for the temperate Mohave Desert and for the desert iguana, Dipsosaurus dorsalis (Porter et al., 1973), have been refined and are applicable to a tropical area and a tropical species. Field microclimate measurements and observations of lizard activity and food consumption by different sizes of lizards are consistent with these models. Environmental constraints on activity times, sun vs shade locations, height above the ground and postures are described. The sensitivity of the metabolic predictions to different maximum temperature preferences and behavioral options are discussed. The balance between maintenance energy savings via lower thermoregulatory temperatures and time available in different parts of the microenvironment are examined. A simple predator-prey interaction illustrates the substantial effect of climate in modifying amount of time both prey and predator would be expected to be active simultaneously in the tropics vs a temperate desert. Comparisons are made between A. agama and the desert iguana, D. dorsalis for daily and seasonal maintenance requirements and their implications for seasonal changes in growth and reproductive potential.},

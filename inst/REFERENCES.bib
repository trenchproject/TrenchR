  abstract = {The daily and seasonal activity of the African rainbow lizard, Agama agama is predicted in terms of heat transfer models for the microenvironment and the lizard. The models, originally developed for the temperate Mohave Desert and for the desert iguana, Dipsosaurus dorsalis (Porter et al., 1973), have been refined and are applicable to a tropical area and a tropical species. Field microclimate measurements and observations of lizard activity and food consumption by different sizes of lizards are consistent with these models. Environmental constraints on activity times, sun vs shade locations, height above the ground and postures are described. The sensitivity of the metabolic predictions to different maximum temperature preferences and behavioral options are discussed. The balance between maintenance energy savings via lower thermoregulatory temperatures and time available in different parts of the microenvironment are examined. A simple predator-prey interaction illustrates the substantial effect of climate in modifying amount of time both prey and predator would be expected to be active simultaneously in the tropics vs a temperate desert. Comparisons are made between A. agama and the desert iguana, D. dorsalis for daily and seasonal maintenance requirements and their implications for seasonal changes in growth and reproductive potential.},

  abstract = {We restrained forty-nine nymphal migratory grasshoppers (Melanoplus sanguinipes) in a series of orientations to the sun and measured rate of temperature change due to radiation intercepted, compensating for temperature loss by convection and greybody reradiation. Direct solar radiation affected body temperature significantly, but diffuse radiation did not. The coefficient of direct solar heating (Hdir), varied from 0.603 to 0.690 depending on how radiation interception was estimated, and on whether insect size was expressed as mass or as a function of length. H is the rate of temperature change as a proportion of the maximum rate assuming complete conversion of all incident radiation to heat. None of the Hdir estimates was significantly different from visible-spectrum absorbance to (0.722), suggesting that the latter is a reasonable approximation of Hdir In simulations, equilibrium body temperature elevation decreased with body size where energy influx was expressed as the amount intercepted (W), but increased with body size when expressed as insolation as (W m-2) because at a specified insolation, the amount of energy intercepted increases with body size. Expressing energy influx as the amount intercepted reveals the underlying biophysical mechanisms which determine body temperature. This paper presents a model of body temperature elevation in which fundamental physical processes are assembled to provide good estimates. This basis in physics implies that the model can can be applied with confidence to conditions other than those in which it was derived.},

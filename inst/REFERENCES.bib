  abstract = {Mechanistic models of the H2O and energy dynamic interrelationships between a terrestrial amphibian and its environments were developed and applied in a study of the temperature and water relations of the northern leopard frog Rana pipiens Schreber. The models illustrate the relative importance of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, absorbed solar and thermal radiation, substrate temperature, and soil H2O potential on the core temperatures, hydration levels, and rates of hydration level change during desiccation and rehydration for leopard frogs of different size. Leopard frogs' core temperatures are influenced most by ambient air and substrate temperatures, whereas absorbed radiation has a subordinant effect. Evaporative H2O loss rates are strongly influenced by absorbed radiation and virtually not influenced at all by substrate temperature (relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed were also shown to be strongly influential on evaporative H2O loss). Water uptake from wet soils (ψsoil > —150 mb) is determined primarily by the properties of the frog, whereas H2O uptake from relatively drier soils (ψsoil < —300 mb) is determined by the conductive properties of the soil. Results of computer simulations suggest that leopard frogs in southern Wisconsin environments should not be found at great distances from standing H2O or soils with H2O potentials < —150 mb. Data taken from the literature and viewed in context of the theory of H2O exchange between an amphibian and soil, suggests that leopard frogs may rarely venture from saturated soils (ψ soil = 0). Results of simulations also imply that leopard frogs in most natural environmental circumstances will not generally have core temperatures greatly different from ambient air temperatures; thus, implying that any behavioral thermoregulatory ability would likely be crude. The modeling approach provides an extremely practical technique to study mechanistic interactions of the many environmental variables involved in the temperature and water relations of terrestrial amphibians.},

  abstract = {Abstract Body shape and body size are hugely important for the understanding of multiple ecological phenomena. In order to study and compare sizes across taxa and to understand the ecological significance of shape differences, there is a need for ways to ‘translate’ different size measurements to a common metric. Body mass is the most useful such common index for size across taxa. Based on a large (>900 species in 28 families) dataset of lizard and amphisbaenian weights, I generate equations to estimate weights from the common size index used in lizard morphometrics (snout–vent length). I then use a species-level phylogenetic hypothesis to examine the ecological factors that affect the variation in weight–length relationships. Legless and leg-reduced lizards are characterized by shallower allometric slopes, and thus long-bodied legless species are lighter than legged lizards of comparable length. Among legged species, the foraging strategy strongly influences the weights, with sit-and-wait species being bulkier at comparable lengths than active foraging species. Environmental productivity (positively related to mass) and activity times (diurnal species being heavier) are only significant when using non-phylogenetic models. The need for effective locomotion is a major factor affecting lizard shape. Previously used allometric equations are inaccurate.},

  abstract = {The way of life of amphibians and reptiles, in contrast to that of birds and mammals, is based on low energy flow. Many of the morphological and physiological characteristics of ectothermal tetrapods that are normally considered to be primitive are in fact adaptations that facilitate a life of low energy demand. Their modest energy requirements allow amphibians and reptiles to exploit various adaptive zones unavailable to birds and mammals. Small body size is the most important of these; 80% of all lizard species and 90% of salamanders have adult body masses less than those of small birds and mammals. An elongate body form, a widespread and successful morphotype among amphibians and reptiles, is energetically unfeasible for endotherms. Amphibians and reptiles also are better suited than birds and mammals to ecological situations characterized by periodic shortages of food, water, or oxygen. At the ecosystem level, the most important consequence of the low energy requirements of amphibians and reptiles is their efficiency of biomass production, which greatly exceeds that of birds and mammals. Their secondary production makes amphibians and reptiles as important as birds or mammals in terrestrial ecosystems.},

The limitations on adaptation provided by environmental variability and the adaptive mechanisms involved are emphasized. Colias behaviorally thermoregulate by body orientation to solar radiation to achieve the body temperatures (30°—40°C) needed for flight. There are differences among Colias populations in solar absorptivity of the ventral hind wing and fur thickness on the ventral thorax correlate with elevation. Energy balance and behavioral models based on meteorological inputs and the thermoregulatory characteristics of the butterfly are developed and tested. These accurately predict body temperatures and flight activity of the population throughout the day at each site. High levels of flight activity occur whenever body temperatures are 30°—40°, particularly at higher elevations. Short—term meteorological variation, such as intermittent cloudy periods, can rapidly reduce body temperature excess and flight activity to zero. The time available for flight activity per day is greater in low—elevation than in higher populations, even when differences in cloudiness are taken into account. Climate space analysis reveals that the overlap in flight space for populations at low and high elevations is °80\% for sunny conditions. The minimum possible overlap in flight space between Colias butterflies is °40\%, due to limitations imposed by the mechanisms of thermoregulation and wing color determination. These limitations are inadequate to explain the observed differences in flight activity with elevation. The microevolution of thermoregulation in Colias is discussed in terms of mechanistic limitations to adaptation, population tracking of the thermal environment, and the role of environment variability.},

Generally, small declines in egg viability may be more than offset by large increases in available flight time at higher elevations. 4. Interactions between environmental conditions and phenotypes may produce unexpected, individualistic responses to climate change.},

Psoloessa delicatula was found to possess an elaborate repertoire of thermoregulatory postures and shade seeking behavior. This grasshopper was found in habitats in the shortgrass prairie in which bare patches of ground were common. It was found to regulate its body temperature to a relatively constant level over the course of a sunny day. Eritettix simplex was found in patches of dense vegetation, and its body temperature was usually similar to ambient temperature. During controlled laboratory experiments, E. simplex nymphs lost water rapidly and thus were presumed to be restricted to more mesic environments where desiccation stress is less. A thermal energy budget model was constructed and showed that the habitat selected by P. delicatula would allow behavioral thermoregulation whereas the habitat selected by E. simplex should preclude regulation of body temperature by behavioral means.},

The accuracy of this relation is established through comparison with available convection results from animal shapes ranging in size and shape from spiders to cows. This relation allows an extrapolation to animal shapes for which data are not available. Results are also presented for the enhancement of convection heat transfer due to natural turbulence. A procedure is outlined for estimating the convecture heat loss from an animal in the natural outdoor environment.}

  abstract = {Abstract We investigated the adaptive significance of behavioural thermoregulation in univoltine populations of the grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes along an altitudinal gradient in California using laboratory tests of animals raised under different temperatures. Trials consisted of continuous body temperature measurements with semi-implanted microprobes in a test arena, and observation and simultaneous recording of behavioural responses. These responses included mobility, basking and orientation of the body axes (aspect angle) towards a radiation source. Mobility and basking are determined by the altitudinal origin of the parental generation and not by the temperature treatments. With increasing altitude, individuals tend increasingly to raise body temperatures via mobility and increased basking. In contrast, body orientation towards the radiation source is influenced by the temperature treatments but not by the altitude of origin. Individuals experiencing higher temperatures during rearing show a lower tendency to lateral flanking. We conclude that body orientation responses are not adapted locally. In contrast other components of the behavioural syndrome that increase body temperature, such as mobility and basking, are adaptive in response to local selection pressure. The thermoregulatory syndrome of these grasshoppers is an important contribution to life-history adaptations that appropriately match season lengths.},

Field microclimate measurements and observations of lizard activity and food consumption by different sizes of lizards are consistent with these models. Environmental constraints on activity times, sun vs shade locations, height above the ground and postures are described. The sensitivity of the metabolic predictions to different maximum temperature preferences and behavioral options are discussed.

  abstract = {Abstract Species ranges are constrained by the physiological tolerances of organisms to climatic conditions. By incorporating physiological constraints, species distribution models can identify how biotic and abiotic factors constrain a species' geographic range. Rates of water loss influence species distributions, but characterizing water loss for an individual requires complex calculations. Skin resistance to water loss (ri) is considered to be the most informative metric of water loss rates because it controls for experimental biases. However, calculating ri requires biophysical equations to solve for the resistance of the air that surrounds an organism, termed the boundary layer resistance (rb). Here, we compared theoretical and empirical methods for measuring skin resistance to water loss of a Plethodon salamander collected from nature. For the empirical methods, we measured rb of agar replicas at five body sizes, two temperatures, three vapor pressure deficits, and six flow rates using a flow-through system. We also calculated rb using biophysical equations under the same experimental conditions. We then determined the ecological implications of incorporating skin and boundary layer resistance into a species range model that estimated potential activity time and energy balance throughout the geographic range of the study species. We found that empirical methods for calculating rb resulted in negative values of ri, whereas biophysical calculations produced meaningful values of ri. The species range model determined that ignoring realistic boundary layer and skin resistances reduced average estimates of energy balance by as much as 64\% and potential activity time by 88\% throughout the spatial extent of the model. We conclude that the use of agar replicas is an inadequate technique to characterize skin resistance to water loss, and incorporating boundary layer and skin resistances to water loss improves estimates of activity and energetics for mechanistic species distribution models. More importantly, our study suggests that incorporating the physical processes underlying rates of water loss could improve estimates of habitat suitability for many animals.},

  abstract = {A physically based model was built to predict the transient body temperature of lizards in a thermally heterogeneous environment. Six heat transfer terms were taken into account in this model: solar radiation, convective heat flow, longwave radiation, conductive heat flow, metabolic heat gain and respiratory energy loss. In order to enhance the model predictive power, a Monte Carlo simulation was employed to calibrate the bio-physical parameters of the target animal. Animal experiments were conducted to evaluate the calibrated body temperature model in a terrarium under a controlled thermal environment. To avoid disturbances of the animal, thermal infrared imagers were used to measure the land surface temperature and the body temperature. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of lizard's transient temperature was substantially increased by the use of Monte Carlo techniques (RMSE=0.59°C) compared to standard model parameterization (RMSE=1.35°C). Because the model calibration technique presented here is based on physical principles, it should be also useful in more complex, field situations.}

  abstract = {We restrained forty-nine nymphal migratory grasshoppers (Melanoplus sanguinipes) in a series of orientations to the sun and measured rate of temperature change due to radiation intercepted, compensating for temperature loss by convection and greybody reradiation. Direct solar radiation affected body temperature significantly, but diffuse radiation did not. The coefficient of direct solar heating (Hdir), varied from 0.603 to 0.690 depending on how radiation interception was estimated, and on whether insect size was expressed as mass or as a function of length. H is the rate of temperature change as a proportion of the maximum rate assuming complete conversion of all incident radiation to heat. None of the Hdir estimates was significantly different from visible-spectrum absorbance to (0.722), suggesting that the latter is a reasonable approximation of Hdir In simulations, equilibrium body temperature elevation decreased with body size where energy influx was expressed as the amount intercepted (W), but increased with body size when expressed as insolation as (W m-2) because at a specified insolation, the amount of energy intercepted increases with body size. Expressing energy influx as the amount intercepted reveals the underlying biophysical mechanisms which determine body temperature. This paper presents a model of body temperature elevation in which fundamental physical processes are assembled to provide good estimates. This basis in physics implies that the model can can be applied with confidence to conditions other than those in which it was derived.},

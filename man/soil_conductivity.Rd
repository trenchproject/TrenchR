\title{Estimate soil thermal conductivity}
\usage{
soil_conductivity(x, lambda, g_a)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is a vector of volume fractions of soil constituents (e.g., clay, quartz, minerals other than quartz, organic matter, water, air).  The volume fractions should sum to 1. Note that x and lambda values in the example correspond to these soil constituents.}

\item{lambda}{is a vector of the thermal conductivities (W m^-1 K^-1) of the soil constituents.}

\item{g_a}{is a shape factor on soil particles.  The soil particles are assumed to be ellipsoids with axes g_a, g_b, and g_c, where g_a +g_b +g_c=1 and g_a=g_b.  de Vries 1952 suggests g_a=g_b=0.125.}

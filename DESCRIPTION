Package: TrenchR
Title: Assessing the Impact of the Environment on Organisms
Description: The TrenchR package aids in Translating
    Environmental Change into organismal responses. The package includes
    microclimate models to vertically scale weather station data to
    organismal heights. The biophysical modelling tools include both
    general models for heat flows and specific models to predict body
    temperatures for a variety of ectothermic taxa. Additional functions
    model and temporally partition air and soil temperatures and solar
    radiation. We offer utility functions to aid in estimating the
    organismal and environonmental parameters needed for biophysical
    ecology. TrenchR focuses on relatively simple and modular functions so users
    can create transparent and flexible biophysical models.

Title: An R Package Encompassing Functions for Assessing the Impact of the Environment of Organisms
Description: We aim to create an R package (TrenchR) encompassing resources
             for assessing the impact of the environment of organisms. 
             The package will build off and integrate with existing packages 
             (e.g., NicheMapR). Code (scripts and functions) will be accepting
             in any programming language and thorough commenting will be appreciated. 
             We would also appreciate your including a header that describes the intent, input, and output of your scripts and functions.
